For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement 
that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50 and order by the age descending..

| people | | |
| -- | -- | -- |
| id | name | age |

*** 

A possible solution is:
```
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    peopl
WHERE 
    age>50
ORDER BY 
    age DESC;
```
