The objective of this function is to determine whether a given positive integer, referred to as 'factor,' is a factor of another non-negative integer, known as 'base.' The function should return a boolean value, returning 'true' if the provided 'factor' is a factor of the 'base' and 'false' if it is not.

> Factors are numbers that, when multiplied together, produce another given number. For instance, for the numbers 2 and 3: 2 * 3 = 6, so 2 and 3 are factors of 6.

To determine if 'factor' is a factor of 'base':
1. Perform the division of 'base' by 'factor.'
2. If the remainder of this division operation is zero, then 'factor' is a factor of 'base.'

***

A possible solution:
```
SELECT 
    base % factor = 0 as is_factor
FROM 
    table
```

***This query will calculate the modulo operation (%) between the 'base' and 'factor' columns for each row in the table and return a boolean value (1 for true, 0 for false) in the 'is_factor' column, indicating whether the 'factor' is a factor of the 'base' in each row.***
